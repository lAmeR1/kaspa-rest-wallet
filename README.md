# Usage

With POST /wallet you can create a new wallet. You can use a self-generated UUID or use random one (leave "uuid" blank).
The UUID is connected to a certain wallet address, which is fixed.

By creating a wallet you'll get the mnemonic (12-words-seed) for these wallet.

You can use this wallet for small games, scripts, etc.

# Running instance

Kaspa REST Wallet is live at https://kaspagames.org/api/api-docs.
Feel free to use it, if you want. Please be aware, that neither me or anyone of the kaspa community is responsible for what happen with the wallets.

# Important

Neither me or one of the kaspa community is responsible for what happens with the $KAS on the wallets. When you create the wallet, you get mnemonic and you are 100% responsible by your own.

# Why this wallet ?

This kind of wallet is NOT made for holding KAS coins. It is made for an easy automation, like for a Kaspa-Game, where users can play around a little bit. The API is simple HTTP, so you can use it with almost every programming language.

Please do not use it for holding your coins.
